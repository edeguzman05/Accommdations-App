## Requirements
This project grabs voices from your OS system, as well as your browser. For the best performance, you may want to use Google Chrome. Works with both Windows and Linux Distributions.

This may possibly work with Mac and MacOS, however due to the constraint of not having a Mac device, testing for Mac was out of the picture. However, this should work with Safari and Mac devices.

## About the App
The app is a way for SPED student to communicate, express and accommodate for whatever they may need, from soundboard, to TTS, to a tokenboard, to even a whiteboard. Users have the ability to create their own tokenboard stickers, have their own customizable soundboard, draw on a whiteboard that can be used for school work, and communicate 

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)
This provides a way of communication for non-verbal students. This feature grabs voices from both the operating system and browser. Chrome, for example, provides multiple languages and voices, such as English, Russian, German, Spanish and different dialects of Japanese!

## Soundboard
This provides the user to use different sounds, such as those from a user's favorite video game or favorite show. Maybe they have a favorite sound they simply cannot live without. By uploading an MP3 of their sound they love, this creates a soundboard that the user can play. They can also can use it for communication and within their tokenboard so that they can hear that favorite sound, making earning a reward from a tokenboard even better!

## Token Board
This creates a token board for students who use a token economy in order to help reinforce their good behavior! 5 tokens, with supervision, allows them to win a reward! This in turn helps them create good habits and allows them to learn how to act.

## Whiteboard
This is a white board for students! This allows a student to use their whiteboard! They can use it for free time to draw pictures OR even use it for school work such as math work, or even just to spell out a word! The whiteboard offers much opportunity for students!

## General Settings
General settings for the app, such as size of side bar and the general UI of the app. Font size can also be changed, as well as background size, and the color of sidebar buttons. The main application is light, and easy to use.
